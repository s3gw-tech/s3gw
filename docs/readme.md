# s3gw Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/example-mkdocs-basic/badge/?version=latest)](https://s3gw-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The documentation for the s3gw project is generated by
[Mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs), which is a project documentation
generator using Markdown.

It is hosted in [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) which takes care of
building, versioning, and hosting the documentation.

The generated documentation for this project can be found
[here](https://s3gw-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting started

If you are using Read the Docs for the first time, have a look at the official
[Read the Docs Tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html).

This is how our documentation is currently structured:

- [docs/](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/tree/main/docs)
  A basic MkDocs project lives in `docs/`, it was generated using MkDocs defaults.
  All the `*.md` make up sections in the documentation.

- [.readthedocs.yaml](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/tree/main/.readthedocs.yaml)
  Read the Docs Build configuration is stored in `.readthedocs.yaml`.

- [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/tree/main/mkdocs.yaml)
  A [MkDocs configuration](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/) is
  stored here, including the navigation structure, a few extensions for MkDocs
  and Markdown. Add your own configurations here, such as extensions and themes.
  Remember that many extensions and themes require additional Python packages to
  be installed.

- [docs/requirements.txt](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/tree/main/docs/requirements.txt)
  and
- [docs/requirements.in](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/tree/main/docs/requirements.in)
  Python dependencies are
  [pinned](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/reproducible-builds.html)
  (uses [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) here. Make
  sure to add your Python dependencies to `requirements.txt` or if you choose
  [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), edit
  `docs/requirements.in` and remember to run to run
  `pip-compile docs/requirements.in`.

## Run Mkdocs locally

This project has a standard MkDocs layout which is built by Read the Docs almost
the same way that you would build it locally.

You can build and view this documentation project locally - we recommend that
you activate
[a local Python virtual environment first](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment):

```console
# Install required Python dependencies (MkDocs etc.)
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

# Run the mkdocs development server
mkdocs serve
```

That's it! You're now able to run the s3gw project documentation locally.
