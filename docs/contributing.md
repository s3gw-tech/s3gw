## Reporting an issue

If one finds a problem, as one is bound to at this point in time, we encourage
everyone to check out our [issues list][1]
and either file a new issue if the observed behavior has not been reported
yet, or to contribute with further details to an existing issue.

## Pull request prerequisites

- If the PR fixes a GitHub issue, then add the line `Fixes: https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/issues/<ISSUE_NR>`
  to the Git commit message.
- Make sure your Git commit is signed with a GPG key.
- Include unit tests if possible.
- Append a line to the CHANGELOG.md of the corresponding GH project. If the
  PR references an issue, then please also add the comment `(gh#aquarist-labs/s3gw#<ISSUE_NR>)`.
